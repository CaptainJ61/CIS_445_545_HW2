    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>
        Hello my name is James Difiglio and this is my personal Webpage, created for the purpose of 
    completing a project for CIS445. This webpage will provide brief summaries of my life, 
    education and other stuff about me.<br><br>
    </p>

    <h4>Brief History</h4>
    <p>
        I has born in 1999, and spent most of my life growing up in Plainfield Illinois. I spent 
    my first 3 years of high school at <a href="https://pnhs.psd202.org/">Plainfield North High School</a>. However due to financial 
    reasons my family moved to Hickory Hills of the same state where I would spend my senior year
    at <a href="https://www.d230.org/Stagg">Almos Alonzo Stagg High School</a> and graduated.
    </p>

    <h4>Education</h4>
    <p>
        After High School I began taking classes at <a href="https://www.morainevalley.edu/">Moraine Valley Community College</a> and in 2020, 
    I recieved my Associate in Science. As of right now I am a senior at <a href="https://www.bradley.edu/">Bradley University</a>. I'm 
    majoring in computer science with a concentration in game technology and plan to get a 
    Bachelor's degree in 2022.
